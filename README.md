# Day-of-the-Week

This application tells the user what day of the week has been on a certain date that is given to the system by the user.

The user can input a date (format DD/MM/YYYY) and the program will tell the user what day of the week that date was.
NOTE: the program will accept any 8 digit String type at the moment, it only checks if the given input is 8 digits in length.
